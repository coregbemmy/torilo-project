		<h2 style="text-align: center;"> I am so glad to share a bit of the life my dad lived, our memories and the legacy he left behind. It was a life worth celebrating and should often be remembered. </h1>
	<p>Hmm, what can i say about the world's best dad? Literally, everyone calls him Baba, he was this dark, middle height man. So kind and selfless, gentle, humble, honest, loving, hardworking and very liberal even though we didn't have much.</p>
	<p>I didn't quickly realise why we all call him baba, because he was not an old man. I later got to know through the way he co-ordinates things in our compound, settles quarrels, gives advices and follow up, helps people get loan if he can't afford it himself, helps relatives and strangers, above all he was a very devoted husband and father, so compassionate about the affairs of his immediate family. Trust me, had it been he ran for chairmanship or counsellor of our Local government, he would have won. He would have made a very good political or spiritual leader.
	 </p> 
	 <p> Even though he didn't leave much before he died (he had a house, a land and some other things), but we are always happy when we remember the lives he had touched.
		 <ul> <li> I remember how he tells us stories of how he helped in training his cousin brother and step brother to 	go to school and to travel out of the country respectively. </li>
		 	<li> Numerous times nieces, nephews, cousins bothe from his side and my mum will come to get food-stuffs and money to take to school. </li>
		 	<li> There was a day he saw a man from afar parked at a filling station across our house late in the evening, he said the man seemed confused, my dad crossed to meet him, asked him what's wrong, he came back home, fetched water from our backyard, took it to the man, they poured inside the radiator, did some other things and it worked. The man offered him money, he refused it, my dad told me he was just happy to help, they exchanged contacts afterwards and became friends.</li>
		 	<li> My dad built 2 houses for his step brother in Brazil, died while building the third.</li>
		 </ul>
	 </p> 
	 <p> Though my dad couldn't attend higher institution, he made sure all his children did, he died while our last born was seeking admission into the university. Right from when we were small, he'll cook, bath (painful scrubs though) and prepare us for school. We didn't have any cause to covet other people's things in school or at home because he made sure he provided them. We went to boarding school except my our first born (a boy), my dad will travel with us to school on the day of resumption, come for most of the visiting days, get us clothes and provision. My dad bought clothes for we his grown up children till he died. He's also a very good talker.</p> 
	 <p> Through all these he did and more, i learn to always be selfless and loving. Something he told me one time that keeps ringing in my mind, <q>ma se abosi...</q> meaning don't live an hypocritic or deceptive life, which i'm really holding onto and living upto.</p>
	 <p> Though he didn't live long enough, he died at the age of  56, but i believe he lived a fulfilled life. I believed his legacy will go wide when i saw the huge crowd that came for his burial and prayers for the family. There were some people we don't know that saw his obituary outside, came inside our apartment and started telling us different stories of how my dad had helped, encouraged them in one way or the other.</p> 
	 <p> Truly, life is but a stopping place, we all have different journeys and path along the way. I learnt from my dad to live a positive life before i leave, and that i'll do. <b> REST ON BABA...</b> </p>
